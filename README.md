# Pharmacy Ainj Scraper

The Pharmacy Ainj Scraper project focuses on extracting important data about pharmacies listed on the ainj.co.jp website. This web scraping tool collects information such as pharmacy name, address, phone number, business status, and pharmacy URL from multiple pages of the site. The extracted data is then saved into a CSV file for easy further analysis or usage.

The project starts by accessing and navigating through multiple pharmacy listing pages using Selenium. The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML and extract relevant information. This data is then organized into a structured format and written into a CSV file for efficient storage and use.

By automating the data collection process, this project allows businesses, researchers, or developers to quickly gather detailed information about pharmacies in Japan, which can be used for market analysis, partnership opportunities, or business research.

The project is implemented in Python, using libraries such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup, WebDriver Manager, and CSV for web scraping and data storage. The tool ensures an efficient and automated way to scrape and save large amounts of data without manual intervention.
